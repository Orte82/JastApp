    // Collections => improve quality and speed of program

    // methods
    // add(E obj) adds object to collection and returns true if added and false if this object is in collection
    // boolean contains(Object obj) => checks if collection contains element
    // Object[] toArray() => changes collection to array
    // <T> T[] toArray(T a[]) => copy collection elements to array of objects of distinct type

    // Collections => storage which support different methods of object ordering and storing with idea of possibility
    //  access to them

    // Collections represent implementation of different abstract data structures and support 3 main operations
    //  add new element into collection
    //  remove element from collection
    //  change element in collection
